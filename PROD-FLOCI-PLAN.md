# Plan — Run swe-quizzes on AWS via Floci (separated frontend/backend)

Goal: replace the Render deployment (single Spring Boot jar serving a bundled
Angular dist) with a production-shaped topology running on **AWS emulated by Floci**.
Frontend and backend are deployed and accessed **separately**, via Floci URLs.

## Target architecture

```
Browser
  │
  ├─ http://swe-quizzes-frontend.s3.localhost.floci.io:4566   ← Angular static site (S3)
  │        │  (JS calls absolute API URL)
  │        ▼
  └─ http://localhost:8081  ──►  ALB (ELBv2 listener :8081)
                                   │  rule /api/* → target group
                                   ▼
                                 ECS service (Fargate) → Spring Boot container (:8080)
                                   │  SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL
                                   ▼
                                 RDS PostgreSQL 16 (Flyway runs V1–V8 on boot)
```

Three AWS services replace Render: **S3** (frontend), **ECS + ECR + ALB** (backend),
**RDS** (Postgres). All provisioned by **Terraform** pointed at `http://localhost:4566`.

## The one real app-code problem to solve

The Angular app calls the API with **relative paths**
(`this.http.post('/api/auth/login', …)` across `auth.service.ts`,
`settings.service.ts`, `quiz.service.ts`). That only works today because Spring Boot
serves the frontend from the same origin. Once the frontend lives on its own S3 URL,
those calls resolve against the S3 host and 404.

So "separated" requires two changes:

1. **Frontend:** introduce an API base URL and prefix every call with it.
2. **Backend:** add CORS to allow the S3 website origin (today there is no CORS
   config — `WebConfig.java` only serves static files).

## Changes by area

### 1. Frontend (Angular)
- Add `src/environments/environment.ts` (dev: `apiUrl: ''`, so `/api` keeps working
  with `proxy.conf.json`) and `environment.prod.ts`
  (`apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8081'` — the ALB).
- Wire `fileReplacements` in `angular.json` for the production configuration, and set
  an `outputPath`.
- Centralize the base URL: a small `API_BASE` token / `ApiService`, or update the 3
  services to use `` `${environment.apiUrl}/api/...` `` (~3 files).
- `npm run build` → static bundle uploaded to S3. **No Dockerfile for the frontend.**

### 2. Backend (Spring Boot)
- **Externalize the datasource** — `application.properties` currently hardcodes
  `localhost:5432`. Switch to env-driven: `spring.datasource.url=${SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL}`,
  username/password likewise (Spring already maps `SPRING_DATASOURCE_*` env vars, so
  possibly no file change is needed — confirm and keep a local default).
- **Add CORS config** allowing the S3 website origin for `/api/**`.
- Leave `WebConfig.java` as-is or trim static-serving (harmless once no static files
  are bundled). The build **stops copying Angular into `resources/static`** — backend
  is API-only now.
- New **`backend/Dockerfile`** (replaces `Dockerfile.render`): runtime image on 8080.

### 3. Infra (Terraform) — new `infra/` dir
- `provider.tf`: AWS provider with `endpoints {}` all → `http://localhost:4566`, fake
  creds, `s3_use_path_style`, skip credential/metadata validation (LocalStack-style).
- `s3.tf`: bucket + `aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration` (public-read site).
- `ecr.tf`: repository for the backend image.
- `rds.tf`: `aws_db_instance` Postgres 16, db `swequizzes`.
- `ecs.tf`: cluster, task definition (image from ECR, env vars incl.
  `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` → RDS endpoint), service.
- `alb.tf`: load balancer, target group, listener on `:8081`, rule
  `/api/* → backend`.
- `outputs.tf`: prints the frontend URL and ALB URL.

### 4. Floci compose
- Add the **ALB listener port** and any ECS-exposed ports to `floci-compose.yml` port
  mappings (Floci runs in a container, so listener sockets must be published — the ELB
  docs call this out). `7001-7099` (RDS proxy) and `4566` are already exposed.

### 5. Orchestration script — `deploy-floci.sh`
Order: `terraform apply` → `mvn package` → `docker build` backend →
`docker push` to Floci ECR → force ECS new deployment → `ng build` frontend →
`aws s3 sync` to the bucket → print URLs.

### 6. Docs / cleanup
- Update `FLOCI-README.md` (or new `PROD-FLOCI.md`) with the deploy steps and URLs.
- Retire Render artifacts: `Dockerfile.render`, `build-dist.sh`, `render-deploy.md`,
  and the `Dockerfile.render` reference in `PROD-DIST.md` (confirm before deleting).

## Honest risks / things to validate first (spikes)

1. **ALB → ECS target wiring.** Floci's ELB docs emphasize **EC2 *instance* targets**
   ("resolved through EC2 instance private addresses"); ECS-Fargate auto-registration
   into an ALB target group (IP targets) may be partial.
   **Mitigation/spike:** verify the ECS service registers with the target group; if
   not, fall back to either (a) backend on EC2 instead of Fargate (instance targets,
   well-supported), or (b) skip the ALB and expose the ECS task port directly. Prove
   this with a tiny nginx task before wiring the real backend.
2. **RDS readiness timing** — backend must wait for RDS; add a healthcheck/retry so
   Flyway does not fail on first boot.
3. **S3 website endpoint host resolution** — `*.localhost.floci.io` resolves to
   `127.0.0.1` per the docs, so the browser URL works without `/etc/hosts` edits.
   Confirm the exact website-endpoint form.

## Deliverables when approved

New: `infra/*.tf`, `backend/Dockerfile`, `frontend/src/environments/*.ts`,
`deploy-floci.sh`, updated `angular.json`, `floci-compose.yml`, the 3 Angular services
+ CORS config, updated docs.

Removed (with approval): `Dockerfile.render`, `build-dist.sh`, `render-deploy.md`.

## Roadmap

Mark items `[x]` as they are completed.

### Phase 0 — Spike & setup
- [x] Floci running via `docker compose -f floci-compose.yml up` (healthy on :4566)
- [x] AWS CLI configured against Floci (endpoint + dummy creds verified)
- [x] Terraform installed (v1.15.6, HashiCorp tap) and reachable on PATH
- [x] **Spike:** ALB → ECS wiring proven — nginx ECS task served HTTP 200 through ALB listener :8081
- [x] Topology locked: **Fargate + ALB (ip targets)**, ECS `load_balancer` block auto-registers the task

> Spike notes: ECS runs real containers on Floci's `swe-quizzes_default` network; ECS
> service `--load-balancers` auto-registers the task IP into the target group; ALB
> traffic routes correctly even though target health stays `initial` and
> `register-targets` returns a cosmetic serialization error. The ALB listener port
> (`8081`) must be published in `floci-compose.yml` to be reachable from the browser.

### Phase 1 — Frontend (Angular) ✅
- [x] Add `environment.ts` (dev) and `environment.prod.ts` (`apiUrl` → ALB)
- [x] Wire `fileReplacements` + `outputPath` (`dist/frontend`) in `angular.json`
- [x] Replace relative `/api` calls with `${apiUrl}/api/...` in the 3 services
- [x] `npm run build` produces a clean static bundle (ALB URL baked into prod, tests 19/19 green)

### Phase 2 — Backend (Spring Boot) ✅
- [x] Externalize datasource via `SPRING_DATASOURCE_*` env vars (local default kept)
- [x] Add CORS config allowing the S3 website origin for `/api/**` (`app.cors.allowed-origins`)
- [x] Stop bundling Angular into `resources/static` — removed static files + SPA handler (API-only)
- [x] New `backend/Dockerfile` (multi-stage, listens on 8080) — image builds locally ✓

### Phase 3 — Infra (Terraform `infra/`) ✅
- [x] `provider.tf` — endpoints → Floci, path-style S3, skip validations
- [x] `s3.tf` — bucket + website configuration + public-read policy
- [x] `ecr.tf` — backend image repository
- [x] `rds.tf` — Postgres 16 instance (db `swequizzes`) — real container `available`
- [x] `ecs.tf` — cluster, task definition, service (datasource env → RDS, no exec role)
- [x] `alb.tf` — load balancer, target group (ip), listener :8081 (forward-all)
- [x] `outputs.tf` — frontend URL, backend URL, ECR URL, RDS endpoint
- [x] `terraform apply` succeeds end-to-end (12 resources)

> Apply discoveries: ECR registry is on `localhost:5100` (now published in
> `floci-compose.yml`); RDS resolves to `172.18.0.2:7001` (Floci host + proxy port),
> reachable from the ECS task. ECS service is ACTIVE with 0 running tasks until the
> image is pushed in Phase 4.

### Phase 4 — Wiring & deploy ✅
- [x] Expose ALB port 8081 in `floci-compose.yml`; pin ECR registry port; path-style ECR URIs
- [x] `deploy-floci.sh` orchestrates apply → build → push → deploy → sync
- [x] Backend reachable through the ALB (`/api/categories`, `/api/settings/public` → 200)
- [x] RDS connected; Flyway V1–V8 applied cleanly on startup
- [x] Frontend served from S3 (`…s3.localhost.floci.io:4566`), CORS origin corrected
- [x] End-to-end verified: S3 frontend → ALB → ECS → RDS returns live data

> Gotchas resolved: `*.localhost` doesn't resolve on Docker Desktop → path-style ECR
> (`FLOCI_SERVICES_ECR_URI_STYLE=path`, pinned `BASE_PORT=5100`). Floci has no
> `s3-website` host — buckets serve via virtual-hosted `<bucket>.s3.localhost.floci.io`;
> the CORS origin and `frontend_url` were corrected to match. Recreating the Floci
> container resets the emulated cloud (no control-plane persistence) — re-run
> `deploy-floci.sh` after any compose change.
>
> Known limitation: SPA deep-link refresh (e.g. `/quiz/1`) returns 404 — Floci doesn't
> apply S3 `error_document` for virtual-hosted GETs. The app works entered from `/`
> (client-side routing); only direct deep-link reloads 404.

### Phase 5 — Docs & cleanup ✅
- [x] Update `FLOCI-README.md` with deploy steps, URLs, and a rebuild tutorial
- [x] Remove Render artifacts (`Dockerfile.render`, `build-dist.sh`, `docker-build-push.sh`, `render-deploy.md`, `PROD-DIST.md`)
- [x] Update `README.md` — deployment now Terraform → AWS via Floci

### Post-deploy fix
- [x] `crypto.randomUUID` fallback — it is undefined over plain HTTP (non-secure
      context); threw in `App.ngOnInit` and blocked the initial render. Fixed in
      `settings.service.ts`, frontend rebuilt and re-synced.

## Open questions

- **Spike first?** Recommend validating risk #1 (ALB→ECS) with a throwaway nginx task
  before committing to the full ECS+ALB wiring — it is the only part that could force a
  topology change (Fargate→EC2).
- **Render cleanup** — delete `Dockerfile.render`, `build-dist.sh`, and
  `render-deploy.md`, or keep them for now?
